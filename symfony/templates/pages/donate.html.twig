    <h1>
        TL;DR
    </h1>
    <p>
        getfursu.it was given to you for free, how about you give something back and <strong>donate a few bucks
            to a charity</strong> of your choice, whether it be for animals&#8203;/environment/&#8203;people?
    </p>

    <h2>Please donate</h2>

    <p>
        How much are you going to spend on the fursuit stuff? Tens, hundreds, thousands? Would it really make
        a big difference if you added a few bucks on top of it and give it to a charity? I don't want to point
        out which one. Please follow your heart and donate to the charity which you most want to support.
    </p>

        I don't know how many hours have i spent on developing and maintaining this website. All this effort was given
        to you for free<sup>1</sup>, and has been secured by the free/open &amp; permissive licenses applied<sup>2</sup>.
        I don't want anything in return<sup>3</sup>. Would all this motivate you to - in exchange - do something good
        for someone in need? If I knew it did, that would definitely made my day.
    </p>

        1 - In the future you might see some ads here for the sake of infrastructure funding.<br />
        2 - See the <i>Licenses</i> section on the <a href="{{ path('info', {_fragment: 'licenses'}) }}">Info</a> page.<br />
        3 - OK, i'll take hugs.
