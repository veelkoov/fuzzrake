        You can enjoy all the fandom has to offer, including attending conventions, joining fursuit walks, meetings, on-line activities, art and so on. You can ask fursuiters for selfies with them and for hugs. All of this without the need to pay for your own fursuit and waiting weeks/months for its completion.

    <h4 id="fursuits-require-significant-effort" class="pt-3">Fursuits require <strong>significant effort</strong></h4>

    <p>
        A lot of effort it required not only to get a fursuit, but also after getting it.

        <p>
            To get a fursuit, you will need to find a maker, go through the ordering process (including getting a quote, creating DTD in most cases, etc.). That's quite a lot. And after you will get your suit, you will need to maintain it in good shape, especially keep it clean.
        </p>
        <p>
            Worth noting, wearing a fursuit is some kind of effort as well. It looks cute and fun from outside, but you must be prepared for some inconveniences, especially high temperatures, and limited breathability.

    <h4 id="fursuit-is-an-expensive-luxury-item" class="pt-3">Fursuit is an <strong>expensive, luxury</strong> item</h4>

    <p>
        Fursuits are often very expensive... unless when you want to sell yours.

        <a data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse2">Read more</a>
    </p>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapse2">
        <p>
            Each fursuit is a unique, hand-made item, created by an artist. Fursuits are not mass-produced. They require materials which are not cheap as well (primarily fur).
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the situation changes 180&deg; if you want to sell yours. You will find it difficult to resell it, and you won't sell it at the price you bought it. Probably far cheaper. Thus, "changing your mind" after buying one would be unfortunate.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>High prices of fursuits are the reason for many scammers and thieves being out there. This topic is covered wider later on this page.</strong>

        A lot of makers don't work with minors.

        <p>
            There are variety of reasons, including legal - making a financial transaction. Cheating will probably get you in trouble. If you want the fursuit so bad, and you get caught, you may never be able to get the fursuit from your beloved makers. They share information, and they won't be willing to work with you anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            One important thing you should also consider is the fact that you still grow. Given that fursuits are expensive, are you sure you want to spend your money on something you may soon no longer fit?

        You could also decide to get a "pre-made" or commission artistic liberty suit.

        <p>
            If you don't have your own original character (fursona) designed, or you don't necessarily want to be cosplaying it in particular, there are alternatives. You can buy a pre-made: ready to buy fursuit designed how the maker imagined it - pretty popular option. Some makers also offer artistic liberty commissions, where you give the maker more freedom designing your suit.

    <p>
        Unfortunately, scammers and unreliable makers are not cooperating, and they continuously refuse to clearly label themselves as scammers or unreliable makers. :( So you need to be careful.

    <h4 id="but-the-maker-is-on-getfursuit-so-they-are-reliable-right" class="pt-3">"But the maker is on getfursu.it, so they are reliable, right?"</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>NO, getfursu.it doesn't guarantee safety!</strong> This website is a single-person effort; I don't have enough time &amp; energy to do all the background checks.
    </p>

    <p>
        New makers are marked like this: <span class="new-artisan"><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> recently added</span>. Everyone starts some day, so everyone will bear that mark at some point. But if a scammer made it on getfursu.it, they would probably still have this. Be more careful (or even "carefulest") with those makers.

                <li>
                    You do not need a paid reference sheet, you can use free templates. You can also draw it all yourself, or add some special additional parts to a free template you use. (Don't be a jerk, don't remove credits from free templates!)
