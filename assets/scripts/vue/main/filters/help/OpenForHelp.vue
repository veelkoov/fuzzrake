  <li>Some makers provide precise information, for example "Parts commissions open", while others tend to post only
    generic "Commissions open". Take this into account when filtering. You may want to combine multiple options here,
    and other filters as well.
  </li>
  <li>Not every maker is tracked. You may want to check the <em>Not tracked</em> option if you don't get satisfying
    results otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>Due to the limitation of the software, getfursu.it fails detecting statuses in some circumstances. You may want to
    try selecting <em>Tracking issues</em> option to check makers whose pages cause trouble to getfursu.it
  </li>
  <li>To read about how the tracking feature work and <strong>what are all the limitations</strong>, <a
      href="{{ path('tracking', {'_fragment': 'tracking_limitations'}) }}" target="_blank">click here</a>. <!-- FIXME -->
