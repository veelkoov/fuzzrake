            What is the point of all of this?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Protection of your information on getfursu.it against unauthorized changes performed by displeased clients or quote requesters, pranksters, and folks under the influence of particular substances.
        </p>

        <h5>
            How will you confirm it was me, now?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Most often I achieve this by finding connection between old website/accounts, which were previously/already linked on getfursu.it, to the e-mail/account you are able to send me a message from, today.
        </p>

        <h5>
            Why is "no contact allowed" even an option?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Because I personally hate SPAM, and even though I don't plan to send any, I understand some people don't want to provide their e-mail address everywhere right away. So I want to give a real choice if you want to give me the address or not.
