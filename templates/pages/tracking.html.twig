    <h1 id="general-idea">General idea</h1>

    <p>
        To allow getfursu.it visitors filter by commissions status, makers can choose a page to be tracked. The tracking happens twice a day. Once the maker announces opening on their page, it should be reflected here within half a day. {# grep-tracking-frequency #}
    </p>

    <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Updates are delayed</strong>: getfursu.it updates statuses twice a day, so it may even take 12 hours for the updates done by a maker to be reflected here. Take this into account if you are waiting for your beloved maker to open. You'd better follow their social media or other stuff. {# grep-tracking-frequency #}
        </li>
        <li>
            The software can make mistakes and will use the privilege.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some websites are not supported (see below). This includes those requiring visitors to be registered&amp;logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
            getfursu.it is unable to "click" any links, buttons, etc. Exact address, where the status is published, must be submitted to getfursu.it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only simple English language is supported.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To make getfursu.it track and update your status, familarize yourself with the <em>Limitations</em> (above) and check the <em>Do's and dont's</em> (below). Then you can choose the page to be tracked by <a href="{{ path('iu_form_step_start') }}">filling the inclusion/update form</a>, providing the tracked page's address in correct field.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's easy to forget about the tracking once set up. <strong>Remember:</strong> whenever you change address of your website, or sometimes even rename the page (which can cause address to change in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system#Installation_type" target="_blank">CMSes</a>), getfursu.it will not automatically update that - you will need to send the form again.

                    Facebook. <small class="text-muted">I don't recommend using it for tracking. It's unpredictable regarding when it requires to log in. Can't guarantee getfursu.it will be able to check your page. If you want to use it either way (at your own risk), I recommend putting the commissions info into your "about" page and tracking it.</small>

If you need getfursu.it to track your "Accepting Commissions" setting, please state that clearly in the notes! If you only put your status as text in your profile, you are good to go. <strong>NOTE 3</strong>: There were issues with accessing FA in the past, but stuff seems to be working fine now.</small>
