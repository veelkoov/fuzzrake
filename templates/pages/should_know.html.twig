    <h1>What you should know</h1>

    <!-- https://twitter.com/FursuitReview/status/1484344172672786437 -->

    <h2>Do you want to become a furry?</h2>

    <p>
        Great news! <strong>You don't have to buy a fursuit to be a furry.</strong> You can enjoy all the fandom has to offer, including attending conventions, joining fursuit walks, meetings, on-line activities, art and so on. You can ask fursuiters for selfies with them and for hugs. All of this for free, right now, without waiting weeks/months a fursuit.
    </p>

    <h2>Fursuit is a luxury item</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Each fursuit is a unique, hand-made item, made by an artist.</strong> Fursuits are not mass-produced, they often get expensive.
    </p>

    <h2>Fix your expectations</h2>

    <h3>About how your fursuit will look like</h3>
    <p>
        Your maker will not "copy" someone else's style. Don't ask for such an approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>You are not getting your fursuit soon.</strong> Be patient and don't take any rush decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a maker state their <strong>completion time</strong>, this most probably <strong>doesn't include</strong> queue time, payment plans or retrieval of materials or your DTD.
    </p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>
        Your maker may not respond immediately. They may be in a different timezone, they may be asleep right now. They don't work 24/7, they may have weekends and/or days off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Talk with the maker about <strong>frequency of updates/WIPs</strong>. Do not assume anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your maker may work on some other fursuit at the same time. {# "Some may work one at a time while others do multiple/similar parts at a time." #}
    </p>

    <h2>Do your part</h2>
    <p>
        You <strong>need</strong> an exhaustive reference sheet. Have it to avoid misunderstandings. Text description is not enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Be safe</h2>

    <h3>"A maker is listed on getfursu.it, so they are reliable, right?"</h3>

    <p style="font-size: 1000%;">NO!</p>
