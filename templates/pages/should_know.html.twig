    <h1>What you should know</h1>

    <p class="text-bold text-danger">This is a work in progress. In fact, this is one of the most "scratchpady" thing on this website. Nothing is to be considered final and/or complete.</p>

    <h2>Do you want to become a furry?</h2>

    <p>
        Great news! <strong>You don't have to buy a fursuit to be a furry.</strong> You can enjoy all the fandom has to offer, including attending conventions, joining fursuit walks, meetings, on-line activities, art and so on. You can ask fursuiters for selfies with them and for hugs. All of this right now, without need to pay for your own fursuit and waiting weeks/months for it's completion.
    </p>

    <h2>Fursuit is a luxury item</h2>

    <p>
        Each fursuit is a unique, hand-made item, made by an artist. <strong>Fursuits are not mass-produced, they often get expensive.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Fix your expectations</h2>

    <h3>About how your fursuit will look like</h3>
    <p>
        Your maker will not "copy" someone else's style. Don't ask for such an approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>You are not getting your fursuit soon.</strong> Be patient and don't make any rush decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a maker state their <strong>completion time</strong>, this most probably <strong>doesn't include</strong> queue time, payment plans or retrieval of materials or your DTD.
    </p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Do not expect the maker to respond immediately.</strong> (Including when they already started working on your suit!) They may be in a different timezone, they may be asleep right now. They don't work 24/7, they may have weekends and/or days off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Talk with the maker about <strong>frequency of updates/WIPs - do not assume</strong> anything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your maker may work on some other fursuit at the same time. {# "Some may work one at a time while others do multiple/similar parts at a time." #}
    </p>

    <h2>Do your part</h2>
    <p>
        You <strong>need</strong> an exhaustive reference sheet. Have it to avoid misunderstandings. Text description is not enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Be safe</h2>

    <h3>"A maker is listed on getfursu.it, so they are reliable, right?"</h3>

    <p>
        No, <strong>getfursu.it doesn't guarantee safety</strong>. This website is a single-person effort; I don't have enough time &amp; energy to do all the background checks.
    </p>

    <p>
        New makers are marked like this: <span class="new-artisan"><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> recently added</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Use e-mail for communication.</strong> Many messengers allow erasing of the history for both sides. If discussing something over IM, send a compilation of things agreed on through e-mail and request confirmation (this will also reduce risk of misunderstandings).
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
    </ul>
