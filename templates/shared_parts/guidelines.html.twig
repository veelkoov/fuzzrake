<h1>Guidelines for makers/studios</h1>

<p class="small">Last update: 2024-01-23</p>

<p>
    <strong>website/social/account</strong> = your website(s) or social media account(s)/profile(s) like DeviantArt/Fur Affinity/Facebook/Instagram/Twitter and others
    <br>
    <strong>user</strong> = getfursu.it visitor, possibly browsing your information and navigating further to your <em>website/social/account</em>
</p>

<h5>1. Your <em>websites/social/accounts</em></h5>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
        <td class="small">A.</td>
        <td>One compliant <em>website/<wbr>social/<wbr>account</em> is a minimum</td>
        <td class="small text-muted"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">B.</td>
        <td>Example fursuit work photos are required</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">You need some solid examples of your past fursuit work creations on your <em>website/social/account</em>. Unfortunately, yet obviously, art like pictures, badges, etc., is not fursuit-related. You won't join getfursu.it to find funding for your first creations. Consider your own fursuit or starting up with some pre-mades.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">C.</td>
        <td>A convenient way to contact you is required on your <em>website/social/account</em></td>
        <td class="small text-muted">It is not OK to force someone to register in a service to send you a message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">D.</td>
        <td>No registration/logging-in requirement</td>
        <td class="small text-muted"><em>Websites/social/accounts</em> should not require <em>users</em> to be logged in. This includes e.g. Fur Affinity, assuming you configured your user page that way. A prompt encouraging to register is just annoying, but a "login or register" screen is unacceptable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">E.</td>
        <td>No "work in progress" <em>websites/social/accounts</em></td>
        <td class="small text-muted">Websites missing content, showing example pages, sample texts are not accepted. Some clients treat website-having makers as preferable and/or trustworthy. However, if you do not have a website yet, you'd better make sure you have some nice portfolio on DeviantArt/Fur Affinity/social first. You can fit any information, FAQ, TOS, and other stuff there as well. Creating a website is time-consuming and/or expensive. It's better to not have a website, than having one raising doubts/eyebrows.</td>
    </tr>

<h5>2. Your information on getfursu.it</h5>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
        <td class="small">A.</td>
        <td>(simple) English only, not even bilingual</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">Your <em>website/social/account</em> doesn't have to be in English. However, all information here must be. If you don't speak English, please ask someone for help with translation and make sure to clearly state that you don't speak English in the dedicated section of the inclusion/update form.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">B.</td>
        <td>No email/"open"/instant messaging contact info</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">E-mail address, phone number, Telegram, Messenger, Discord, Skype, etc. - such info belongs to your <em>website/social/account</em>, and may (probably will) be removed from your submission.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">C.</td>
        <td>Don't ever mention other studios/makers</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">You cannot e.g. claim to be friends with someone or (have) work(ed) for someone. Not even a shout-out. Such statements may get removed or your whole submission may get rejected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">D.</td>
        <td>Photos must show exclusively your creations</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">You must not submit photos on which fursuits or other stuff created by others can be seen, e.g. taken during a convention. This could confuse the <em>user</em>.</td>
    </tr>

<h5>3. General</h5>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
        <td class="small">A.</td>
        <td>Use common sense and be fair</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">
            This list of rules deliberately skips stuff covered by common sense. For example, it should be obvious that you must not provide any false or misleading information or claim somebody else's work.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="small">B.</td>
        <td>Guidelines may change</td>
        <td class="small text-muted">
            I do not own a crystal ball and can't create perfect guidelines. They will change over time whenever doing so will bring more pros than cons. I may contact you, asking to correct your data to comply with the updated guidelines.
            <br>
            <br>
            History of changes can be checked in git. I can assist you in using it if you don't know how.
